# [CSS Questions](http://cssquestions.io/)


A list of CSS questions I wrote down while reading MDN CSS docs.

Orignally I was frustrated that "CSS questions" returned a bunch "Top 5-20 CSS questions" blog posts, so I thought a resource with more questions and is focused onl on CSS questions might be useful. Not sure if it will be useful to anyone else though.
