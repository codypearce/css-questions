# [CSS Questions](http://cssquestions.io/)


A list of CSS questions I wrote down while reading MDN CSS docs.

Orignally I was frustrated searching for "CSS questinos" and getting a bunch "Top 5-20 CSS questions" blog posts, so I thought a resource that's only CSS questions might be useful. Not sure if it will be useful to anyone else though.
