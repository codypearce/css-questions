# [CSS Questions](http://cssquestions.io/)

A list of 140 CSS questions and answers. Written while reading the MDN CSS docs.

## Examples

Does the proximity of an element to another element have any effect on levels of specificity?

What does LVHA mean in CSS?

What does :not(\*) select?

What are the three parameters the clamp() function takes?

## Why

I was frustrated that searching "CSS questions" returned a bunch of "Top 5-20 CSS questions" blog posts with questions that rarely asked actual CSS Questions. I thought a resource with more questions that focused soley on CSS might be useful.

## Contributing

New questions, better wording, and other fixes are all welcome. Many questions were written in a short time period and could use review.

All questions are stored in `questions`
