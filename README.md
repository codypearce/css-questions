# [CSS Questions](http://cssquestions.io/)

[cssquestions.io](http://cssquestions.io/)

A list of 140 CSS questions. Written while reading the MDN CSS docs.

## Why

I was frustrated that searching "CSS questions" returned a bunch of "Top 5-20 CSS questions" blog posts with questions that rarely asked actual CSS Questions. I thought a resource with more questions that focused soley on CSS might be useful.
